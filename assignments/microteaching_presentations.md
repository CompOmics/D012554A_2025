**Structure for the presentation (10 minutes presentation; 10 minutes questions):**

1. **Introduction**
   - Introduce the paper and neccesary background, such as data used and research question

2.  **Results**
   -   Highlight and explain the ML method, go beyond the paper itself explain the ML method
   -   Highlight the main result of the paper
   -   Highlight the main conclusion of the paper

2.  **Discussion**
   -   Discuss the things the authors did right from a ML perspective, e.g., the choice for algorithm/study design is appropiate
   -   Discuss the things the authors did not do right from a ML perspective, e.g., the choice for algorithm/study design is not appropiate
   -   Discuss potential follow-ups from a ML perspective
