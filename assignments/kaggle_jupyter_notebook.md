### Deliverable: Kaggle Notebook with an Embedded Report

You are required to submit one comprehensive Kaggle Notebook that includes both your code and a brief report. The report should be written using markdown cells and organized into **three sections only**: **Methods, Results, and Discussion**. Use the following notebook structure as a guideline:

#### **Notebook Structure**

1.  **Methods**
    
    -   **Custom CNN Training**
        -   **Architecture Description:** Detail your custom CNN design, including key layers and hyperparameters.
        -   **Training Procedure:** Outline the training settings (e.g., learning rate, batch size, number of epochs) along with relevant code snippets.
    -   **Fine-Tuning a Pre-Trained Model**
        -   **Model Selection and Adaptation:** Explain which pre-trained model you chose and how you modified it for the PathMNIST64 dataset.
        -   **Training Details:** Provide details on the fine-tuning process and training settings.
    -   **Data Augmentation**
        -   **Techniques Implemented:** Describe the augmentation methods you applied.
        -   **Integration:** Show how these augmentations were incorporated into your training pipeline with examples from your code.
2.  **Results**
    
    -   **Performance Metrics:** Present the evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) and training times for both the custom CNN and the fine-tuned model.
    -   **Visualizations:** Include charts such as loss curves, accuracy plots, and any tables or graphs that compare the outcomes with and without data augmentation.
3.  **Discussion**
    
    -   **Analysis:** Compare the performance and training times between the two approaches.
    -   **Data Augmentation Impact:** Discuss the effect of data augmentation on model performance and any trade-offs observed.

### Submission Guidelines

-   **Submission Format:** Share your Kaggle Notebook with your instructor. Ensure the notebook runs from start to finish on Kaggle without errors.
-   **Evaluation Criteria:**
    -   Clear and modular code.
    -   The thoroughness and clarity of the embedded report (Methods, Results, and Discussion).
    -   Depth of analysis when comparing training from scratch versus fine-tuning and the role of data augmentation.
    -   Effective use of visualizations to support your findings.
    -   Overall presentation and reproducibility of results.
